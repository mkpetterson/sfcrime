    "## Does classifying non-violent crime as a misdemenor increase car break-ins?\n",
    "In 2014 California Proposition 47 classified many non-violent crimes as misdemenors. Did this increase the rate of car break ins realtive to violent crime? Did it also lower the resolution rate of car break ins relative to other crime? \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a possibility that people stopped reporting break-ins once they knew the police were unlikely to pursue. It's also possible that crime over all increased or decreased, so the important metric is ratio of car break ins to violent crime. \n",
